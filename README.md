**Doorman S3** is a versatile intercom gateway designed to connect your [TCS](https://www.tcsag.de/) or [Koch](https://www.kochag.ch/) intercom system to any home automation platform. It's also compatible with rebranded versions of [Niko](https://www.niko.eu/), [Scantron](https://scantron.dk/), and older [Jung](https://www.jung-group.com/) intercom models.

But that's not all - the **Doorman S3** is more than just an intercom bridge. With its integrated relay, you can simulate button presses to control door openers or lights, supporting up to **40V** and a maximum of **2.5A**. 

Even if your intercom system isn't directly listed, if it operates on a **2-wire bus** in the **14-24V DC range**, you may still be able to implement other protocols. Additionally, you can monitor voltage levels from older intercom systems to trigger actions based on those readings.

For more information on the manufacturing process, head to the **Manufacturing** section further down.

If your TCS or Koch intercom uses **screw terminals labeled `a`, `b`, and `P`** and operates on **24V DC**, it's most likely compatible with **Doorman**.

For more in-depth compatibility information, refer to the [Compatibility Docs](https://doorman.azon.ai/guide/hardware-compatibility).
