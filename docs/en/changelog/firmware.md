### ✨ Improvements
- **Better Entity Grouping**  
   Navigate with ease! **Entities** are now more logically grouped on the webserver for effortless control and access.

- **Simplified ESPHome Configuration**  
   We’ve made the ESPHome config files **more modular**! Configurations are now split into separate add-ons for smoother management.

- **Doorman Discovery**  
   We've introduced a new custom protocol that enables seamless discovery of other devices running this firmware for troubleshooting, as well as those utilizing the [custom Doorman firmware](../guide/firmware/custom-firmware) .

### 📝 Other Updates
- **Component Name Change**  
   The `tcs_intercom` component has been renamed to **`tc_bus`** and merged into this repository. All documentation is now centralized [here](../reference/esphome-component).

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **Re-setup Required!**  
   The new protocol means you’ll need to **reconfigure** your system. Old stored commands won't work anymore. Simply **press the apartment or entrance doorbell** to start the setup again.  

   👉 **Check the [setup guide](../guide/getting-started#step-3-interactive-setup) for details!**

- **New Service Names**  
   We’ve made changes to the Home Assistant service names to make them easier to understand and use:
   - **Old Format**:
     ```yaml
     service: esphome.doorman_s3_send_tcs_command
     data:
       command: 0x1C30BA41
     ```
   - **New Format**:
     ```yaml
     service: esphome.doorman_s3_send_tc_command_raw
     data:
       command: 0x1C30BA41
     ```
   - **New User-Friendly Option**:
     ```yaml
     service: esphome.doorman_s3_send_tc_command
     data:
       type: floor_call  # Command type (e.g., 'floor_call', 'door_open')
       address: 0        # Address, for example the Outdoor Station
       payload: 0        # Data payload
       serial_number: 0  # Indoor Station serial number
     ```
     **Why it’s awesome**: It’s now **more readable** and lets you **easily specify** command types!
