# Stock Firmware <Badge type="tip" text="ESP-IDF Framework" />

This is the preferred firmware as it works out of the box with the Doorman S3 and supports Improv via Bluetooth LE.

### Update Firmware
There are several ways to update the firmware:
- ESPHome OTA <Badge type="warning" text="Requires ESPHome Dashboard, full control" />
- HTTP OTA <Badge type="tip" text="Latest release build, no customization" />
- Web Serial <Badge type="tip" text="Latest release build, no customization" />

Connect your Doorman via USB-C and click the button below to directly install the latest Doorman Stock Firmware (Home Assistant) using Web Serial.
This allows you to easily apply community-provided updates later.
