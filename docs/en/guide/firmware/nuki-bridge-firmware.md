# Nuki Bridge Firmware <Badge type="tip" text="ESP-IDF Framework" />

This configuration inherits all features from the Stock Firmware and adds a Nuki Bridge component via BLE. Note that it does not support Improv via Bluetooth LE, as the BLE stack is used by the Nuki Bridge component.

### Update Firmware
There are several ways to update the firmware:
- ESPHome OTA <Badge type="warning" text="Requires ESPHome Dashboard, full control" />
- HTTP OTA <Badge type="tip" text="Latest release build, no customization" />
- Web Serial <Badge type="tip" text="Latest release build, no customization" />

Connect your Doorman via USB-C and click the button below to directly install the latest Doorman Nuki Bridge Firmware (Home Assistant) using Web Serial.
This allows you to easily apply community-provided updates later.

::: warning
Be aware that some **updates may introduce breaking changes** â€” always review the changelogs carefully to ensure your system functions reliably in critical situations.

To fully customize the firmware and gain complete control, you can adopt it into your ESPHome Dashboard. If you're interested in using the MQTT firmware, simply apply the `Minimal Nuki Bridge Firmware (MQTT)` example YAML below.

## Firmware YAML
This is the minimal ESPHome configuration YAML file for use with Home Assistant. Be sure to update the API key.

## Pairing your Nuki Lock
Depending on the PCB revision, either press the FLASH or PRG button on the Doorman PCB for 5 seconds until the status LED starts flashing purple, or enable the Nuki Pairing Mode switch in Home Assistant. Then, press the button on your Nuki Lock for 5 seconds until the light ring turns on.

After a successful pairing, the status LED will remain steadily on for 3 seconds.

::: warning
If your Nuki Lock is already paired, this process will unpair it!
:::

## Unpairing your Nuki Lock
You can unpair your device using either the `Nuki Unpair Device` button in Home Assistant or the physical `FLASH` or `PRG` button on the Doorman PCB.

::: info Physical Button
If your lock is already paired with Doorman, press the `FLASH` or `PRG` button on the Doorman PCB for 5 seconds until the RGB status LED starts flashing purple. Your Nuki Lock will then be unpaired. Note that the pairing mode will time out after 30 seconds.
