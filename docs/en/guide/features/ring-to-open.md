# Ring To Open <Badge type="warning" text="RTO / Party Mode" />

The Doorman firmware features a Ring To Open automation, which was previously known as Party Mode.

### What does it do?
As the name implies, the entrance door will open automatically when someone rings the doorbell.
This feature is especially useful during a party, allowing guests to enter the building simply by ringing the bell.

### How do I use it?
You can activate or deactivate the Ring to Open function individually for each door.
There are separate switches available, such as `RTO: Entrance Door`, `RTO: Second Entrance Door`, and `RTO: Apartment Door`.

You can also configure an additional trigger, like the function button or the external button.

Additionally, there's a central switch called `Ring to Open`, which can control multiple doors at once.
You can configure which doors are affected via the setting `RTO: Central Toggle – Door Selection`.

#### General Configuration:
::: info Confirmation
If this option is enabled, your indoor station will ring each time the Ring-to-Open automation is triggered by a physical button — depending on which physical button you've configured as the trigger.
:::

::: info Display Status
You can choose whether the status LED should blink while Ring to Open is active for any door.
:::

::: info Central Toggle - Trigger
Define what toggles the central `Ring to Open` switch.
For example, you can set the function button of your indoor station to activate or deactivate the central switch.
:::
