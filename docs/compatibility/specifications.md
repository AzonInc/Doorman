# Doorman Hardware specifications
You can find a few information here about how to use 

## Power supply
Thanks to the wide voltage converter, the Doorman S3 can operate with a supply voltage ranging from 5 to 30V DC.

## Bridge Rectifier
The Bridge Rectifier will correct the Bus wire polarity. You don't have to worry about it.

## Relay
The relay is a solid-state type, capable of switching loads up to 40V with a maximum current of 2.5A.

## External Button
It is a pull-up button with a 10 kÎ© resistor. You can connect the button to BTN and G screw terminals.
