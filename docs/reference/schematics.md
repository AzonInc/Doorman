# Schematics

The schematics for the Doorman are entirely open source and available for reference. You can also find the KiCad source files on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AzonInc/Doorman/tree/master/pcb).

You can explore the PCB and schematics design in the interactive viewers below. (If you are having issues with the viewers, please try refreshing the page.)
