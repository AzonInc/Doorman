::: danger USE WITH GREAT CAUTION
All credentials, global variables, counters and saved states stored in non-volatile memory will be lost with no chance of recovering them. Even raw reading of flash memory with esptool will not help, since data is physically erased from flash memory.

If you configured WiFi using the captive portal, Improv Serial or Improv BLE, this will reset WiFi settings as well, thus making such devices offline. Youâ€™ll need to be in close proximity to your device to configure it again using a built-in WiFi access point and captive portal.
