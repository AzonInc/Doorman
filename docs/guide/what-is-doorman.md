# What is Doorman?

Doorman lets you connect your TCS or Koch intercom to any home automation system.
There are also some rebranded Niko intercoms which are counterparts of the TCS and Koch ones.

However it's not limited to these intercoms only. With the integrated solid state relay you can easily simulate a button press to trigger the door opener or the light (up to 40V, max 2.5A).

If your intercom is not a TCS or Koch one but operates on a 2-wire bus within the 14-24V DC range it might be possible to implement other protocols as well.

You can also monitor the voltage level on older intercoms (14-24V DC) with the internal ADC and trigger specific actions based on it.
