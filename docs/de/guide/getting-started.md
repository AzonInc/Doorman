# Getting started

Here is a detailed guide on setting up your Doorman for the first time. Please note that these instructions are based on the pre-flashed Doorman PCB that I sell.

Thank you for using Doorman! <3

## Setup

### Step 1: Connect to Wi-Fi
When you power on your Doorman-S3 for the first time, it will blink rapidly (orange) and create a new Access Point named `Doorman-S3 Setup`. You can set up your WiFi credentials using the Access Point, Improv Serial, or Improv Bluetooth.

The Access Point password is `open-sesame`.

Once connected to the Access Point, the web interface should open automatically (see also login to network notifications).\
If it doesnâ€™t, you can manually navigate to http://192.168.4.1/ in your browser.

::: tip
You can take advantage of automatic setup in Home Assistant if your Home Assistant has Bluetooth enabled.

Additionally, with mDNS support, Home Assistant will automatically discover your Doorman once it's connected to WiFi.

### Step 2: Connect to Home Assistant
After connecting Doorman to your network, it will blink slowly (blue) and should be automatically discovered by Home Assistant. Simply click on `Configure` to add the newly discovered ESPHome node.

### Step 3: Obtaining Bus commands
::: warning Important
You need to connect Doorman to your intercom first. Please refer to the [Wiring](#wiring) section for details.
:::

You can visit the [ESPHome Integration page](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=esphome) and click on the new Doorman S3 device entry. There, you'll find a Last Bus Command text sensor that tracks the most recent bus command in hexadecimal format.

Additionally, every received command is logged in the ESPHome Console (Debug log level) and published as a Home Assistant event.

**Important Commands:**
- Entrance Doorbell
- Apartment Doorbell
- Open Entrance Door

Press the buttons on your intercom phone to capture the codes, then copy them into the corresponding configuration text inputs.

## ESPHome adoption

If you want to customize your Doorman firmware, you can add the Doorman device to your [ESPHome Dashboard](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_ingress/?addon=5c53de3b_esphome) and flash your customized [Stock](firmware/stock-firmware.md) or [Nuki Bridge](firmware/nuki-bridge-firmware.md) firmware.

After adding the device, your configuration will look like this:

> You can add new components and modify existing ones here. For more information on the possibilities, check out the [Examples](firmware/stock-firmware#examples) section.

> If you need to deeply customize the firmware, you'll need to use the `base.yaml` file from the repository.

## Wiring
First, open your intercom enclosure. On most models, you will find a screw terminal labeled with `a`, `b`, `E`, and `P`.

Connect the `b` line (Ground) to one of the TCS:BUS terminals on your Doorman, and connect the `a` line (24V Bus) to the other TCS:BUS terminal on your Doorman.

### Power supply options:
::: details 3-Wire Mode via intercom <Badge type="tip" text="Recommended" />
Connect the `P` line (+24V) to the `P` terminal on your Doorman.

> [!WARNING]
> The intercom power supply must provide at least 60mA.

Example:

:::

::: details 2-Wire Mode via external wired Power Supply
Connect the external power supply to your Doorman using the `P` (+5V to +30V) and `G` (Ground) screw terminals.

Example:
![2-wire external via screw terminal](./images/2wire_power_screwterminal.png){width=300px}
:::

::: details 2-Wire Mode via external USB-C Power Supply
Connect the external power supply via the USB-C port.

Example:

:::

::: details 2-Wire Mode via intercom <Badge type="danger" text="Impossible" />
> [!DANGER] Unfortunately this scenario is not possible!
> Using the `a`-bus line as a power source results in a loud beeping noise. This issue is likely due to the high-frequency switching power supply and may be addressed in future hardware revisions.
