# Ring To Open <Badge type="warning" text="Party Mode" />

The [Stock Doorman Firmware](../firmware/stock-firmware.md) includes a `Ring To Open` automation.

### What does it do?
As the name already says, the entrance door will be opened as soon as someone rings the entrance doorbell.
It could be useful when you have a party. That way your guests can just enter the building by ringing.

### How do I use it?
You can enable and disable the `Ring To Open` automation with a switch in Home Assistant.
::: tip
It is also possible to configure a delay for the opener command with the `Ring To Open Delay` Number Input in the Configuration section.
